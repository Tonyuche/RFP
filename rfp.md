</div>

### 1. About Us
**TuchSolutions Ltd.** is a customer service solutions company dedicated to helping organizations enhance client satisfaction, streamline support operations, and deliver exceptional service experiences. Through innovative technology, skilled personnel, and customer-centric strategies, TuchSolutions Ltd. empowers businesses to build strong relationships with their clients and achieve long-term loyalty.

### 2. Introduction
**TuchSolutions Ltd.** is seeking proposals from qualified vendors for the design, installation, configuration, and support of a modern wireless network infrastructure across our office premises. The objective is to implement a secure, high-performance wireless environment that supports current and future business needs, including mobility, scalability, and secure access to company resources.

Vendors responding to this RFP should demonstrate experience in enterprise wireless deployments, network security, and ongoing technical support.

### 3. Project Overview
**TuchSolutions Ltd.** requires a comprehensive wireless solution capable of delivering reliable, high-speed connectivity throughout the office. The new wireless network must support Wi-Fi 6 or newer standards, incorporate robust security features, integrate seamlessly with the existing wired infrastructure, and provide centralized management and monitoring. 

The current infrastructure is aging and fails to meet the demands of modern cloud-based applications, video conferencing, and the increasing density of user devices.

### 4. Scope of Work
The selected vendor will be expected to complete the following tasks:

**4.1 Site Survey and Assessment**
  * Conduct a detailed wireless site survey (predictive and on-site measurements).
  * Identify optimal Access Point (AP) placement to ensure complete wireless coverage.
  * Evaluate RF interference sources, wall materials, density of devices, and high-traffic zones.
  * Provide a heatmap demonstrating expected coverage and performance.

**4.2 Wireless Network Design**
  * Develop a wireless infrastructure design tailored to organizational needs.
  * Recommend appropriate AP models, controllers, switches, antennas, and mounting hardware.
  * Provide a channel plan and capacity planning for high-density areas.
  * Design redundancy and failover capabilities.

**4.3 Installation and Configuration**
  * Physically install wireless APs, mounting brackets, and cabling.
  * Configure APs, wireless controllers (if applicable), and management software.
  * Integrate wireless infrastructure with the existing wired network, including VLANs, DHCP, DNS, and routing.
  * Configure SSIDs for employees, guests, and IoT devices with appropriate segmentation.

**4.4 Security Implementation**
  * Enable WPA3 encryption across secure networks.
  * Implement MAC address filtering, role-based access, and device profiling.
  * Configure network access control (NAC) or integrate with existing authentication systems (e.g., RADIUS/Active Directory).
  * Apply best practices for wireless intrusion detection and rogue AP monitoring.

**4.5 Testing and Validation**
  * Validate wireless coverage, throughput, roaming performance, and connection stability.
  * Conduct stress testing for high numbers of simultaneous connections.
  * Provide a final wireless heatmap confirming coverage and capacity.
  * Document test results and resolve any issues prior to handover.

**4.6 Documentation**
  Vendor must provide:
  * Network topology diagrams
  * AP placement diagrams
  * Configuration files and documentation
  * As-built documentation
  * Operational and troubleshooting manuals

**4.7 Training**
  * Provide training to IT staff on wireless management, monitoring tools, and troubleshooting procedures.

**4.8 Ongoing Maintenance and Support**
  * Provide options for ongoing support contracts (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years).
  * Include hardware replacement policies (RMA), firmware updates, and security patching.
  * Provide optional 24/7 technical support and remote monitoring services.

### 5. Technical Requirements
The proposed solution must strictly adhere to the following mandatory technical requirements:

**5.1 Core Performance and Coverage**

* **Full Coverage:** Must provide 100% **coverage** across the entire office premises, including common areas, meeting rooms, and restricted areas, with a minimum RSSI of -65 dBm for primary user areas.

* **Wireless Standard Support:** APs must support the **latest ratified Wi-Fi standard (Wi-Fi 6 or 6E)** and be backward compatible with older standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac).

* **High Capacity:** The solution must be capable of supporting a minimum of **[Specify Number, e.g., 200] simultaneous, high-bandwidth user connections** with minimal latency degradation, leveraging **Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO)** technologies.

**5.2 Security Features**
* **WPA3:** Mandatory support for the **latest Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)** security protocols for enhanced encryption and protection against dictionary attacks.
* **802.1X/RADIUS:** Capability to integrate with existing RADIUS server for enterprise-level user authentication.
* **MAC Address Filtering:** Robust MAC address filtering or Network Access Control (NAC) capability to restrict access for unauthorized devices.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention (WIDS/WIPS):** Built-in or optional features for Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS) to monitor the RF environment for rogue APs and potential threats.

**5.3 Management and Monitoring**
  * **Centralized Management:** The solution must include a single, intuitive centralized management platform (WLC) for configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting.
  * **Heatmap Visualization:** Real-time monitoring capability with visual coverage heatmaps and easy identification of connectivity issues.
  * **Performance Metrics:** Ability to track and report key metrics, including client throughput, latency, utilization per AP, and channel interference.
  * **API Integration:** Provision of **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** for integration with existing Network Management Systems (NMS) and logging tools (e.g., SNMP, Syslog).
